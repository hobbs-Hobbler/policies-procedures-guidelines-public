# **Accessibility Policy**

The [Hubs Foundation](http://hubsfoundation.org/) stands on two pillars: free & open standards and a global community focus.

As a proud contributor to the open-source software movement, Hubs Foundation supports collaboration, sharing, and participation. These activities naturally lead to increased accessibility. Thus, the very nature of Hubs software is open, welcoming, and encouraging for all users of every ability. Further, our homepage invites “artists, creatives, and you to create 3D spaces and publish them online for anyone to visit.” We sincerely believe that the “anyone to visit” phrase means that we should develop and create for every one of us. It is our hope that by encouraging accessible options here, we’ll make it easier for our creators and developers to promote accessible content for the wider world.

This policy will not define accessibility in terms of internet access, internet speed, or general ease of use for users. All of these concerns are already covered within our existing working teams. For example, the development team strives to streamline the computing burden of the Hubs software. The documentation team focuses on clear communication. Both the development and documentation teams increase awareness and documentation of how to access Hubs with smartphones (as an example of commonly available technology) and virtual reality headsets (as an example of less commonly available technology). Further, because the Hubs software was born from the WebXR movement, it centers on browser access and the [benefits that the immersive web provides](https://immersiveweb.dev/).

## **Overall Guidance**

One policy statement like “Try your best” cannot relay our accessibility intentions. So, we avoid generic statements like “[Don’t be evil](https://expertbeacon.com/the-rise-and-fall-of-googles-dont-be-evil-motto/)” or “[Be excellent to each other](https://recroom.com/code-of-conduct/)”. At the same time, here is some guidance.

It is good practice for Hubs Foundation content creators to ask if users with vision, sound, mobility, or cognitive differences of ability can equally access the content and if not, what can be done to increase access. The following overall guidance represents starting ideas, but is not meant as a full checklist.

* **Use the formatting tools already present.** Use title, header, list, table, and equation mark up functions that are already available within the media. For example, do not repeat a title for document meta data; instead briefly describe the contents of the document for a user that might be using a screen reader.
* **Use simple language.** This helps our language translation partners. Avoid sayings, cliches, or elaborate language.	Use "select" or "enter" instead of "click" or "scroll".  
* **Express the same information in two different communication methods.** Provide alternative text (alt text) for all images. Do not rely on color alone to relay meaning. If sound is meant to relay information (for example in a how-to video), include a transcript or a visual indicator.
* **Give the user control.** If an element like sound or speed *can* be controlled by the user, let it be controlled by the user, instead of determined for them. If an experience could cause dizziness, provide an advance warning.

## **No One Walks Alone**

We encourage everyone to address accessibility within Hubs Foundation-produced content, but we also recognize that a “[first attempt at making anything accessible will be awful](https://accessability.substack.com/p/your-first-attempt-at-making-anything)”. Therefore, we’ve structured our efforts so that no single community member must create accessible content alone. A community member will come alongside a content creator to review, suggest, and perhaps directly modify the content to make it more accessible. No one walks alone in this effort; we are a community.

##  **How You Can Help** 

Situated as an XR product within accessibility intentions, Hubs is within “an emerging field and exploration is encouraged” ([XR Accessibility User Requirements, Section 4.10](https://www.w3.org/TR/xaur/#signing-videos-and-text-description-transformation)). Thus, we are always open to suggestions!

You may submit comments on accessibility privately via fictionalemailaddress@hubsfoundation.org.

Also, [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Hubs-Foundation) (Note: include multiple links to separate repository issues??) is available and preferred for open discussion.

Optional footer wording: This policy is a draft document and may be updated, replaced or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to cite this document as other than work in progress.
